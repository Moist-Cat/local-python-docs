<p>This is a crawler-scraper that gets all the pages in the <a href="docs.python.org">docs.python.org</a></p>

<p>The crawler visits all the pages in the site and saves the pages as it visits them. The structure of the site is kept intact. The site's root is mounted at the same location as that of the source file. The location can be changed if required. It can also be put into the localhost so you can view it as a normal site on your browser. Permissions might need to be set or just run the script as the superuser (sudo) on a Unix machine</p>

<p>Also, it fetches all the CSS and JS files from the site</p>
