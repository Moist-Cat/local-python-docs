<p>This is a crawler-scraper that gets all the pages in the <a href="docs.python.org">docs.python.org</a></p>

<p>The crawler visits all the pages in the site and saves the pages as it visits them. The structure of the site is kept intact. The site's root is mounted at the same location as that of the source file. The location can be changed if required. It can also be put into the localhost but permissions might need to be set or the script must be run with the sudo keyword on a Unix machine</p>
